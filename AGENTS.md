# OpenSend Project Context for AI Agents

## Project
OpenSend — Free, ad-free, open-source file sharing. Direct device-to-device transfers. No account required.

**Deployment:** https://opensendbysparsh.vercel.app
**GitHub:** https://github.com/sparshsam/opensend
**Contact:** sparshsam@gmail.com

## Stack
- Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4
- Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, Realtime)
- Vercel (deployment)
- WebRTC (device-to-device P2P transfers)
- MCP SDK (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk) — AI agent integration
- qrcode (QR code generation on canvas)

## Architecture

### Pages
- `/` — Clean homepage with Send and Receive cards only (no method selector, no enter-code on homepage)
- `/send` — Dedicated send flow: method + file selection → large QR + pair code → status states → transfer
- `/receive` — Dedicated receive flow: QR scan info + pair code entry (auto-joins from `?code=&session=` URL params)
- `/t/[code]` — Download page for Cloud Transfer claim codes

### Transfer Methods
1. **Direct Transfer** (primary) — WebRTC P2P via STUN/TURN. QR encodes receive page URL with params.
2. **Bluetooth** (disabled) — Always `supported: false`. Shows "Coming later for native apps."
3. **Cloud Transfer** (fallback) — Supabase Storage upload/download via `/api/guest/upload`. QR shows download URL.

### Signaling
- **Guest transfers:** HTTP polling (`PollSignaling`) — no auth, no WebSocket. Both parties poll `/api/guest/signal` every 500ms.
- **Account transfers:** Supabase Realtime (`SignalingService`) — requires login.

### Guest Transfer Lifecycle
```
created → waiting → paired → transferring → completed
  ↓          ↓          ↓           ↓
  expired   expired   cancelled    failed
```

Statuses enforced server-side on `opensend_guest_sessions`:
- `waiting` — sender created session, awaiting receiver
- `paired` — receiver joined
- `transferring` — WebRTC data channel open, chunks flowing
- `completed` — checksum verified, file saved
- `cancelled` — either side cancelled
- `expired` — 15-minute TTL reached

### Sender State Machine
```
select-file → creating → waiting → receiver-joined → connecting → sending-file → verifying → completed (final)
                                                                                              → failed (if connection drops before _transferCompleted)
```
States: `select-file` | `creating` | `waiting` | `cloud-uploading` | `cloud-ready` | `receiver-joined` | `connecting` | `sending-file` | `verifying` | `completed` | `failed`

### Receiver State Machine
```
idle → looking-up → joining → connected → waiting-for-sender → receiving-file → verifying → completed (final)
                                                                                             → failed
```
States: `idle` | `looking-up` | `joining` | `connected` | `waiting-for-sender` | `receiving-file` | `verifying` | `completed` | `failed`

### Transfer Flow (Direct)
1. Sender selects file, creates guest session (POST /api/guest/sessions)
2. QR shown with URL: `/receive?code=CODE&session=SESSION_ID`
3. Receiver scans QR or enters code manually
4. Receiver calls PATCH with `transfer_code` (not `transfer_secret`) to join
5. Receiver sends "receiver-joined" signal via POST /api/guest/signal
6. Sender's PollSignaling receives "receiver-joined", starts WebRTC offer
7. Sender forwards subsequent signals (answer, ICE candidates) to `engine.handleSignal()`
8. DataChannel opens, file transfers in 16KB chunks
9. SHA-256 checksum computed on receiver, "checksum-ok" sent back over DataChannel
10. Sender receives "checksum-ok" → `_transferCompleted = true` → "Sent successfully"
11. Receiver triggers download prompt — blob with 10s URL lifetime

### MCP Tools (apps/mcp/)
12 tools total:

**Transfer:** `list_my_transfers`, `get_transfer`, `delete_transfer`, `export_transfer_history`
**Device:** `list_my_devices`, `get_device`, `rename_device`, `list_transfer_history`
**Session:** `list_transfer_sessions`, `get_transfer_session`, `list_online_devices`, `get_device_status`

## Design
- **Brand color:** `#bc3fde` (purple)
- **Dark mode:** Deep purple bg (`#1a0422`), light text (`#ffffff`)
- **Light mode:** Lavender bg (`#faf0ff`), dark text (`#1a0422`)
- **Surface:** Dark `#240a30`, Light `#f5e6fa`
- **Font:** Noto Sans Math (Regular 400 only — faux-bold for heavier weights)
- **Buttons:** Pill-shaped (`rounded-full`)
- **Philosophy:** Transfer terminal, not dashboard
- **Mobile:** Bottom nav (Transfer, History, Diagnostics, Profile) with iOS safe area

## Rules for AI Agents
1. All OpenSend DB resources use `opensend_` prefix (never modify OpenSprout tables)
2. Guest transfers must never depend on Supabase auth or accounts
3. Every Supabase query must scope by `user_id` (for signed-in users)
4. MCP tools must maintain strict user isolation
5. WebRTC engine uses hardcoded STUN servers + optional TURN env vars (`NEXT_PUBLIC_TURN_*`)
6. Do not claim E2EE unless fully implemented
7. Dark mode is default for all CSS; light mode is `.light` class override on `<html>`
8. Theme toggle uses `style.setProperty()` to bypass Tailwind v4 CSS cascade issues
9. `body {}` rules must be outside `@layer` blocks to survive Tailwind v4 compilation
10. Contact for all OpenSend projects: sparshsam@gmail.com
11. Do not claim real-device transfer success unless Sparsh manually confirms
12. PATCH `/api/guest/sessions` accepts `transfer_code` for receiver join (limited to `receiver_name` + `status: "paired"`); full `transfer_secret` required for sender-level changes
13. The `_transferCompleted` flag in WebRTCEngine prevents connection-close-after-completion from overwriting the completed state
14. `handleDataChannelMessage` handles `checksum-ok` and `checksum-fail` to complete the sender's verification phase
